    <h1>Asthma</h1>
    <p class="">Asthma is a condition that affects the airways in the lungs, causing difficulty in breathing.</p>
    <h2>Symptoms of asthma</h2>
    <p>The main symptoms of asthma are problems with breathing, such as:</p>
    <ul class="symptoms">
        <li class="symptom">Wheezing</li>
        <li class="symptom">Shortness of breath</li>
        <li class="symptom">Chest tightness</li>
        <li class="symptom">Coughing</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Asthma symptoms can be mild or severe. They usually come and go. They may be worse at night and early in the morning.
    An asthma attack is when you have severe symptoms and it's difficult to breathe, which can be life-threatening.
    Symptoms can be triggered by different things including exercise, high levels of air pollution, cold air, or contact with something you're allergic to, such as pollen, dust, mould or animals.
    Asthma usually starts in children, but it can happen at any age.</p>
    
    <h2>How to treat an asthma attack</h2>
    <p>If you or someone else is having an asthma attack, follow these steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Stay calm and try to relax.</li>
        <li>Use a reliever inhaler (usually blue) as prescribed.</li>
        <li>Loosen any tight clothing.</li>
        <li>Try to breathe slowly and deeply.</li>
        <li>If symptoms don't improve, seek medical help immediately.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>How asthma is diagnosed</h2>
    <p>If you or your child have symptoms of asthma a GP or nurse will ask you some questions and listen to your chest.
    You may need a simple breathing test to check for signs of asthma, and sometimes a blood test.
    You may also be given a handheld device called a peak flow meter to use at home for a few weeks, to check how well your lungs are working.
    Asthma can take some time to diagnose because the symptoms often vary over time and breathing problems can have different causes. If it's likely you have asthma, you may be offered asthma medicines to see if they help your symptoms.</p>
    <h2>Treatment for asthma</h2>
    <p>If you have asthma you'll be supported by a care team including a GP or nurse, and sometimes a specialist hospital doctor.
    Your care team will explain how and when to use your medicines, how to monitor your asthma, ways to avoid triggers and reduce your symptoms, and what to do if your symptoms get worse.
    This will be recorded in your asthma action plan, which you'll need to take to all your asthma appointments. You'll be given a printed or digital copy, or both.
    You should have check-ups at least once a year to see how well your treatment is working. These will include checking that you're using your inhalers correctly and your asthma action plan is up to date.</p>
